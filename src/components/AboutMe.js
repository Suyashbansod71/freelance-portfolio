      <div className='about-description'>
      Hi there Iâ€™m Pranali Khatekar. To be honest, My work has become my identity, 
      and professionally, I specialize in UI/UX design. I'm naturally very curious 
      person and love to decode problems to understand them better. I enjoy working 
      on various projects where I can learn and provide solutions. Design is my 
      passion, and as a hobby, I love sketching portraits to capture memories.
      (View it on Behance) As far as experience goes, I have fair experience working 
      as a solo designer as well as having worked with excellent teams. In my free 
      time, I love playing games and showing that girls can be tough competitors not
       only in video games but also during my school days, I competed in state-level
        rifle shooting competitions. The benefit I gained from this was a stronger 
        focus and has helped me stay more concentrated and committed in various aspects 
        of my life.
